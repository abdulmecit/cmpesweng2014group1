<h1>Personal Info</h1>
I'm Berhan Şenyazar, a senior Computer Engineering student at Boğaziçi University.<br>
<br>
My hometown is Kastamonu but I also consider Karabük, the city I spent my high school years, as my secondary hometown.<br>
<br>
I have an interest for everything with some sort of storytelling, but especially for literature and indie games.<br>
<br>
I'd like to pursue an academic career in cognitive science or artificial intelligence.<br>
