## **What is crowdsourcing?** ##

The word crowdsourcing is simply a combination of “crowd” and “sourcing”. It means getting needed services, ideas, or content from a large group of people especially from an online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. It includes the work of many volunteers or part-time workers, where each contributor takes a small role in the great result. It is kind of outsourcing but in crowdsourcing the work comes from an undefined public instead of a specific group.

The term “crowdsourcing” was coined in 2005 by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson, editors at Wired Magazine. While examining the Internet usage as an outsource in the business world, they reached the conclusion that it is like “outsourcing the crowd”, which led them to the term crowdsourcing. Howe first published a definition for the term "crowdsourcing" in a companion blog post to his June 2006 Wired magazine article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing," which came out in print just days later:

"Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers."

In a February 1, 2008 article, Daren C. Brabham defined "crowdsourcing" as an "online, distributed problem-solving and production model."

Some activities are considered as crowdsourcing even when they are not. And also different authors gave different definitons for the term crowdsourcing. After studying more than 40 definitions of crowdsourcing in the scientific and popular literature, Enrique Estellés-Arolas and Fernando González Ladrón-de-Guevara developed a new integrating definition:

"Crowdsourcing is a type of participative online activity in which an individual, an institution, a non-profit organization, or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number, via a flexible open call, the voluntary undertaking of a task. The undertaking of the task, of variable complexity and modularity, and in which the crowd should participate bringing their work, money, knowledge and/or experience, always entails mutual benefit. The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need, be it economic, social recognition, self-esteem, or the development of individual skills, while the crowdsourcer will obtain and utilize to their advantage that what the user has brought to the venture, whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken".

## **How is crowdsourcing used?** ##

In crowdsourcing, problems are broadcast to the public and people submit solutions to these problems. They might be  amateurs or volunteers, working in their spare time, or experts or small businesses. Sometimes the contributor of the solution is compensated monetarily, with prizes or with recognition.
Crowdsourcing allows companies to gather large numbers of solutions and information at a relatively inexpensive cost. The people that contribute these solutions are motivated by  both intrinsic motivations, such as social contact, intellectual stimulation, and passing time, and by extrinsic motivations, such as financial gain.

Crowdsourcing is used in a variety of tasks.  The crowd may be invited to develop a new technology, carry out a design task, refine or carry out the steps of an algorithm, or help capture, systematize, or analyze large amounts of data.
