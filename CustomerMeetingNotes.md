## Notes ##
Here are the main topics that were discussed in the customer meeting with Suzan Uskudarlı and Hande Alemdar.

  * **User Profiles and Privacy**

What kind of information should be obtained from the users and privacy of these information are discussed. We reached the conclusion that health related issues like disease, alergy or losing weight should be private and food related issues like favorites should be public.

  * **Social Media**

Web sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are very important to get new users. Our web site should allow users to share their recipes or favorite meals on these platforms.

  * **Meal Categories**

We discussed what kind of meal categories should exist. It should include specific meals like international or diet. Also easiness and cost of the meal are important.

  * **The same recipes with a few differences**

What should be done about the same recipes was a great problem for us. We decided that if there are a few differences between recipes, it shouldn’t be a new recipe. The system should allow users to make modifications to the existing recipes. Other than comment section, there should be a section where users can suggest their recipe. In this way, users can see all options for a specific meal.

  * **Mobile Application**

Our customers suggested that the mobile application should allow them to see recipes for a specific food when they see it in a market. Also, if the users have given the information about what they have at home, they should be able to see these foods from the mobile application.

  * **Healthy food**

Before the meeting, healthy food was a great concern for us but in the meeting it is decided that health is not the main issue. We should allow users to see calorie values of the meals but they should decide what they are going to eat and there shouldn’t be just healthy recipes in our list. Also, we don’t need to work with a doctor.

  * The items used in a recipe should include comments of users and information about where they can be found.
  * Users can post videos of the recipes.
  * Users might get title according to their activities or amount of likes for their recipes.
  * Users should be able to search for the foods that are in a specific calorie intervals.
  * We can get calorie information of foods from other sources.
  * When people write their recipe, system should understand and store every item one by one.
  * If the user doesn’t like a specific food, we shouldn’t suggest any meal including that food.
  * Users might share their diet programs, their weekly meal schedule.
  * Web site should include sections like the favorites of the day.
