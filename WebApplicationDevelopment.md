# WEB APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT #

A _**web application**_ is any application software that runs in a web browser or is created in a browser supported programming language (such as the combination of JavaScript HTML and CSS) and relies on a common web browser to render the application.

And _**Web application development**_ is the process and practice of developing web applications.

## **The Web Application Model** ##

The Web application model, like many software development models, is constructed upon 3 tiers:
User Services, Business Services, and Data Services.


The **_user service tier_** creates a visual gateway for the consumer to interact with the application. This can range from basic HTML and DHTML to complex COM components and Java applets.

The user services then grab business logic and procedures from the **_business services_**. This tier can range from Web scripting in ASP/PHP/JSP to server side programming such as TCL, CORBA and PERL, that allows the user to perform complex actions through a Web interface.

The final tier is the **_data service_** layer. For Web applications, databases allow developers to store, retrieve, add to, and update categorical information in a systematic and organized fashion.


## **The Phases in a Web Application Project** ##

The Web application development process has 4 phases:


**1. Envisioning the nature and direction of the project**

In this phase, the management and developers assigned to the project come together and establish the goals that the solution must achieve. This includes recognizing the limitations that are placed on the project, scheduling, and versioning of the application. By the end of this phase, there should be clear documentation on what the application will achieve.

**2. Devising the plan**

What scripting language is most appropriate, which features must be included, and how long will it take? These are some of the questions that must be answered through this planning phase. The main tangents at this point are the project plan and functional specification. The project plan determines a timeframe of events and tasks, while the functional specification outlines in detail how the application will function and flow.

**3. Development**

Once the project plan and functional specification are ready, a baseline is set for the development work to begin. The programmer/s or Web developer/s begin coding, testing and publishing data. This phase establishes the data variables, entities and coding procedures that will be used throughout the remainder of the project. A milestone document is prepared by the development team, which is then handed to management for review.

**4. Testing, support and stability**

The stability phase of the application project mainly focuses on testing and the removal of bugs, discrepancies and network issues that may otherwise cause the application to fail. It is here that policies and procedures are established for a successful support system.


## **Technical option** ##

After deciding the architecture and procedures behind Web application development, there are some technical options to consider for the development process itself.

**1.Windows Web Servers**

Microsoft has built a loyal customer base on one important factor â€“ their easy-to-use software. Windows NT/2000/XP Web servers are very fast and easy to administer. The fact that the operating system is a Windows shell means that administrators and authors can easily allow the Web server to interact with other software and hardware applications to transmit and receive data over the Internet. Popular server side scripting languages used with Windows servers are ASP/ASP. net, Java Server Pages, and PHP.

**2.UNIX/Linux Web Servers**

UNIX has long been known for its reliability. It is a powerful and robust Web server and operating system. Unix is the server of choice for many large-scale Websites that need content management systems or receive an extremely high volume of traffic. Popular server side scripting languages for UNIX are Java Server Pages, PERL, PHP, and CORBA
