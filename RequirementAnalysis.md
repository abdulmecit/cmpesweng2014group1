# Requirement Analysis #

## 1. General Idea ##
This project is about creating a platform for both web and mobile which users can share their food recipes including its nutrition information and explore others'. Users can search recipes with ingredients they have and they can also suggest ingredient substitutions for recipes. People can select their personal preferences or diseases for limiting some recipes. For example, if they have diabetes, they won't see recipes with sugar or if they don't like tomatoes they won't see any recipe that includes tomato. Application will store users' history, like what they ate or liked and will use these information to recommend new recipes.

Web version of the application will be more to see the overview and specialization of users' taste. On the other hand, mobile application will serve user to see recipes quickly, decide what to cook and see what to pick up from market before going home.
