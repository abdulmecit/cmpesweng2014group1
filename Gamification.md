<h2><b>What is gamification?</b></h2>

The term "gamification" was coined in 2002 by Nick Pelling is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems. Gamification is applied to improve user engagement, return on investment, data quality, timeliness, and learning.<br>
<br>
If we want to explain ramification in detail, typically it applies to non-game applications and processes, in order to encourage people to adopt them, or to influence how they are used. Gamification works by making technology more engaging, by encouraging users to engage in desired behaviors, by showing a path to mastery and autonomy, by helping to solve problems and not being a distraction, and by taking advantage of humans' psychological predisposition to engage in gaming. The technique can encourage people to perform chores that they ordinarily consider boring, such as completing surveys, shopping, filling out tax forms, or reading web sites.<br>

<h2><b>Applicatons of gamification</b></h2>

Gamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of Forbes Global 2000 companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention. For example, In 2010, Starbucks gave custom Foursquare badges to people who checked in at multiple locations and offered discounts to people who became mayors of an individual store.<br>
<br>
Gamification has also been used as a tool for customer engagement, and for encouraging desirable website usage behaviour. Additionally, gamification is readily applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on social network services. For example, in August 2010, one site "DevHub" announced that they have increased the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements.<br>
<br>
Education and training are areas where there has been interest in gamification. Microsoft released the game Ribbon Hero 2 as an add-on to their Office productivity suite to help train people to use it effectively, which was described by Microsoft as one of the most popular projects its Office Labs division ever released.<br>
