## 1. General Information ##

Our project is developing an application in which people can share or follow some information about nutrition and recipes. It is simple design application which has both web and mobile versions. Mobile version is very significant because of the portability of mobile devices.

There are some other sites, which are similar to our application. But our project is also different from them. Because, sharing your menu or new recipes, following other people or rating other people’s offers is more important in our application. It is like Facebook or Instagram but its content is about nutrition not the people’s lives.

If we want to go into particulars, for example, we can find a part “I’m lazy” for people who really don’t want to cook, “I’m poor” for people who don’t want to pay much for cooking, ‘’I’m fancy” part for people who want to impress their guests with the view of their foods or “I don’t care” for people who don’t care about calories or healthiness of foods. At the bottom part of the website there are 4 choices.  One of these choices looked funny for me “Random Recipe”. If we click that button website shows us a random recipe.
