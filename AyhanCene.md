# About #

I'm on an endless journey in the pursuit of graduation which is always on another castle.

I don't consider myself lazy but I take my time when I have to do something. There may be two reasons behind this:
  * I've put my best effort on the task at hand
  * Me procrastinating until the very last day

You can guess which one is more often the case.

I also spend my time watching tv-series and animes, playing games and doing other similar stuff that doesn't really help anyone. That being said, I especially enjoy games of role-playing genre.

Oh, I forgot to mention that my sister graduated before me.

After reading all these, you can now be sure of how great a team member I'm going to be. ;)
